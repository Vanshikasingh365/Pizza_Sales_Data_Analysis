##  Sample SQL Queries

```sql
-- 1. Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;

-- 2. Average Order Value
SELECT (SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order_Value FROM pizza_sales;

-- 3. Total Pizzas Sold
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold FROM pizza_sales;

-- 4. Total Orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales;

-- 5. Average Pizzas Per Order
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 
CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) 
AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order
FROM pizza_sales;

-- 6. Daily Trend for Orders
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);

-- 7. Hourly Trend for Orders
SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) as order_hours, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
ORDER BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time);

-- 8. % of Sales by Pizza Category
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;

-- 9. Top 5 Best Sellers
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold DESC;

-- 10. Bottom 5 Best Sellers
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold ASC;
